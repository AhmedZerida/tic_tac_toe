## Description

This project is an implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm. The goal of the project is to provide a challenging single-player experience where players can compete against an AI opponent that plays optimally using the Minimax algorithm.

### Project Features:

- **Minimax Algorithm:** The AI opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move in each turn.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Minimax Algorithm Implementation**
